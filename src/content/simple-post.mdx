# Simple MDX Post

This is a **simple** MDX post that should work with Next.js static export.

## Features

- ✅ Markdown syntax
- ✅ Static generation
- ✅ No complex dependencies

## Code Example

```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, MDX!");
}
```

## Lists

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

### Nested Lists

- Parent item
  - Child item
  - Another child
- Another parent

> This is a blockquote to test rendering.

**Bold text** and *italic text* should work correctly.

That's all! This should render properly with static export.
