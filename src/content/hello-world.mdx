# Hello, World

Welcome to my new blog! This is a minimal blog built with Next.js, MDX, and Tailwind CSS.

## Why Minimal?

I believe that less is more. A blog should be about the content, not about fancy animations or complex layouts. This blog focuses on:

- **Clean typography** that's easy to read
- **Fast loading** with static generation
- **Simple design** that doesn't distract from the content
- **Mobile-friendly** responsive layout

## The Tech Stack

This blog is built with modern web technologies:

- **Next.js** - React framework with static generation
- **MDX** - Markdown with JSX support
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **GitHub Pages** - Free static hosting

## What's Next?

I'll be writing about software development, design, and occasionally other topics that interest me. The goal is to share knowledge and thoughts in a clear, concise way.

Thanks for stopping by!
